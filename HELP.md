Big Data Studio(BDS)

A single platform for all your data science needs.

## History/Data Science?

By definitions, Science and Data-Science are not much different. They both include some common steps or stages like (1) observations, (2) identification, (3) formulation and (4) experimentation/testing.

But what makes them diferent is the data. So far, most things that today's modern world science inventions have identified or experiment figured.

Example: Gravity(Newtons laws), Keplers Laws, Faradays Laws, Bernolis Princile which gave rise to runnning motor vehicles, sailing ships, flying planes and space crafts that can fly to moon and come back.

But the time differences between these discoveries of laws and applicaiton have take time. But today, a modern man with the help Technology, we fasten the process of observing, identificating, formulation and testing.

Just the way Science has provided faster transport, improved health care and medicines, long distance communications and other.

This capability is what gave rise this new era of science, data science - where machines could perform computationally complex pattern matching algorithmns to humangous amount of data(terabyes) and find the solutions to the question we might have failed to answer so far. Cure diseases like cancer, organ issues, immediate health care 24 X 7 for low cost, medicines specific to a persons diet, life style and genes at low cost for all.

Data Science.

## Feature

BDS

File Lodad

* Multiple  Fi

## Users

* Minimal Python Training - No Domain Specific Language is required.
* Loading Files -
    * Just the tell filename - csv/json/.pickle/html
    * Single file or Multiple files - we will handle it. Use regex if it helps.
    * Standard Function Provided:
        1. Loading Data(to a Data Frame)
        * Concatenate Data Frames
        * Merge Data Frames
* Data Engineering Configs

## Developement Goals

* provide a simple pipeline for doing data science
* use native python code - no domain specific language
* make it easy & do only what is requried
* do no re-create exsisting stuff
* standardize the code
